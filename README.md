# dynamical_systems
Development of a comprehensive tool for analyzing dynamical systems by graduate students of the Oscillations Control Group (Institute of Physics of the University of São Paulo).

## Current maps
* Halley
* Hénon
* Simplified Fermi-Ulam model
* Standard
* Standard nontwist 

## Features
* Orbit 
* Phase space
* Interactive phase space (clickSpace)
* Winding number

## ClickSpace commands
* Left click (hold): run orbit for click initial point
* Right click (hold): open zoom window (zoom in when released)
* c: total zoom out
* r: creates initial condition line
* s: destroy initial condition line
* Scrool up|down: increases|decreases the number of points in initial condition line
